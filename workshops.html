          <h3>Workshops</h3>

          This time at IndiaHCI 2014, we are having four one-day workshops - Designing for Gamification, Design for Indian Language Technologies, Professional ethics for UI/UX designers in India and Use of Ethnography to Study HCI-SE Integration. These workshops aim to bring collabration between a mix of practitioners, researchers, faculty members, students and enthusiasts from Indian industry and academia. The workshops are introductory and will give a hands-on experience to the participants. All the four workshops will run parallely on the first day of the conference, that is, on 7<sup id="gamification">th</sup> December, at the same venue - IIT Delhi. 
          <br>
          <br>

          <h4>Work = Play<br>Designing for gamification<br><small>One-day workshop</small></h4>

          <p>Date: December 7, 2014 (TBC)<br>
          Venue: IIT Delhi</p>
          <p>Submission deadline : <s>October 15</s> November 10</p>
          
          <p>Ever come across a useful product or service that just fails because it wasn’t just interesting enough to the user? How often we want a certain task to be performed but there isn’t enough motivation for others? Imagine a group of children playing together without any external reward but for the fun of it. Now, what if you could bring that level of engagement and motivation into any task of your choice? It’s no magic potion, it’s gamification – ‘the use of gaming elements in non-game contexts to motivate desired user behaviors’. To simply put it, it’s about adding just the right amount of playfulness. Let’s take an example.</p>
          <p><i>Problem:</i> Volkswagen wanted people to drive in safe speed limits in Sweden.</p>

          <img class="img-responsive" src="http://www.gunnreport.com/media/agb/originals/Volkswagen-SpeedCameraLottery.jpg"></img>
          <small>image courtesy: http://www.thefuntheory.com/</small>

          <p><i>Solution:</i> They put up a camera and a speed sensor giving immediate feedback to people, informing if they qualify for a lottery to win prize money collected from defaulters. It led to 22% reduction in speed in 3 days. Who wouldn’t want to enter a lottery for driving safe? That’s gamification. The workshop aims to introduce the idea of gamification and its application through a series of fun and interesting exercises. While the initial part of the workshop will focus on internalization of the process of gamification, the participants will later work on real-life challenges/situations to gamify them. Acknowledging the inter-disciplinary nature of the domain, the workshop aims to bring together different perspectives from researchers and practitioners in the areas of play, human-computer interaction, game design, psychology and other invested disciplines to identify the challenges and solutions for gamification in the context of real-life challenges. 
          </p>
          <h5>Participants</h5> 
          <p>This workshop is introductory and exploratory in nature. The participants do not need to be an expert in the field of gamification. We intend to bring together a mix of practitioners, researchers, students and enthusiasts from the Indian industry and academia, who would like to get a hands-on experience on gamification. The participants will be divided into inter-disciplinary teams, each working on gamifying a short and intense real-life problem/situation. Not the least, there will be ample opportunities to be a child again.</p>

          <h5>Submissions</h5>
          <p>The participants are requested to submit a short write-up introducing themselves and throwing some interesting challenges for taking up in the workshop by mailing to <b>gamify.workshop@gmail.com</b> by 5pm on <s>October 15</s> November 10, 2014. The purpose of submission is to get an idea of the mix of participants, which would help in designing the workshop to suit the participants better. The format of submission could be as follows -</p> 


          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Name, location, field of research/ practise</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Experience in the domain of gamification (if any)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">One or two real-life problems with the potential of improvement using gamification<br>

            <p><br>We would really encourage you to identify original problems from your own experiences and not refer internet or other sources. The problem could be based on a useful activity or task from the work-place, personal life or society, which otherwise is boring/dis-engaging. e.g. I need to park my car in the public parking space but I hate the time I need to sort it out (personal life problem), or I want that my office colleagues to interact and get to know each other better but they are not motivated (work-place challenge), or we would like to check wastage of electricity in our institute but how to involve others (Societal problem). We hope to collectively gamify some of the most interesting problems as suggested by you. You may use photographs or any other supportive material for better description of the problem/s. Be creative.</p>



            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Your expectations from the workshop (optional)</li>

          </ul>  

          We will get back to your submissions by November 10.

          <h4>Design for Indian Language Technologies <br><small>One-day workshop</small></h4>
          <p>Date: December 7, 2014 (TBC)<br>
            Venue: IIT Delhi</p>
          <p>Submission deadline : October 15</p>

          <h5>Objective</h5>
          <p>The number of users preferring to use the internet, applications, tools, services, smartphones and other digital devices in non-English Indian languages is growing rapidly. Substantial progress has been made in the research of Indian language technologies such as OCR, text to speech, text input etc. Yet little of this research has translated into actual products that have reached a large number of people. The practitioners operating in the mainstream (both designers and technologists) tend to remain cut off from developments in research, and researchers are not in touch with product developers in the industry. This workshop aims to act as a bridge between researchers and practitioners. It will bring together people from varied domains and trigger a discussion around the development of future products, tools and services related to five specific Indian language technologies - optical character recognition (OCR), speech technologies (text to speech as well as automated speech recognition), text input, typography and type design, handwriting recognition and unicode. At the end of the workshop, we hope to have built fresh connections between designers and technologists and also between researchers and practitioners. We also hope to have delved deeper into some of the technologies and product ideas.</p>

          <h5>Participants</h5>
          <p>This workshop intends to bring together students, faculty members, full-time researchers and industry professionals from design and technology development backgrounds who are keen on working for developing products and services . On the basis of their interests, the participants will be divided into five-six groups, each led by one or two experts in one technology domain listed above.</p>

          <h5>Submissions</h5>
          <p>The participants are requested to submit a one-page position paper by October 15, 2014 about a potential product, tool or a service related to a technology area of their interest. The product, tool or service should have the potential to solve a real-life problem in the society. The format of the submission should be as follows:</p>

          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Chosen area of technology</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Problem in the society</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Product / tool / service description</li>
          </ul>
          Submissions should be mailed to <b>dfilt.workshop@gmail.com</b> by 5 pm on October 15, 2014. Your submission must be in the ACM SIGCHI format that can be downloaded <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform/sigchi-extended-abstracts-word-template/view" target="_blank">here</a>. Invited experts will review the submissions and intimate the participants by November 1.

          <h4>Professional ethics for UI/UX designers in India<br><small>One-day workshop</small></h4>

          <p>Date: December 7, 2014 (TBC)<br>
            Venue: IIT Delhi</p>
          <p>Registration deadline : October 15</p>

          <h5>Objective</h5>
          <p>With the country embracing online commerce like never before, the art of persuasion has reached new heights. Books with words such as nudge, influence, persuade, drive, motivate etc., in their titles are lapped up by businesses and adhered to religiously. The line between persuasion and deception, if ever there was one, has never been blurrier. This has put an enormous strain on designers on how to conduct themselves as employees in an organisation and for project managers to know what is accepted practice.</p>
          <p>Absence of professional code of conduct, weak consumer rights, lack of legislative remedies (such as this 2011 ruling in the EU states) have only exacerbated the issue. The workshop will start the conversation on the issue, with the objective of spreading awareness among design practitioners and educating businesses by coming up with a set of guidelines for ethical practice that can be taken up with professional bodies such as NASSCOM, be part of design education curricula, aid consumer rights groups and even become help legislation in the future.</p>

          <h5>Participants</h5>
          <p>The workshop is suitable for business owners, project managers, UI/UX designers, consumer advocates or conscientious consumers. There are no submission requirements for this workshop, but the workshop closes for registrations on October 15, 2014.</p>

          <h4>Use of Ethnography to Study HCI-SE Integration<br><small>One-day workshop</small></h4>

          <p>Date: December 7, 2014 (TBC)<br>
            Venue: IIT Delhi</p>
          <p>Submission deadline : October 15</p>

          <h5>Objective</h5>
          <p>Several quantitative and qualitative research methods have been applied in the past to integrate HCI in SE and to study its effect on the quality of software. In spite of at least two decades of research from both HCI and SE perspectives, these integration challenges continue to exist. In practice, this integration has yielded some good results and also posed some gaps. Perhaps the answer lies in understanding the root causes of what makes it work and what makes it fail. Use of ethnography to study HCI activities in software development organizations has demonstrated that is possible to get to the root causes of such scenarios in practice. This workshop aims to promote ethnography as a research method amongst practitioners in software organizations to provide deeper understanding of the practical and sociological aspects of inclusion of HCI activities (or lack thereof) in the development of software.</p>

          <h5>Participants</h5>
          <p>This workshop is focused on practitioners who work in software development organizations and are associated with the implementation of HCI activities in software development processes. Contributions are invited from HCI practitioners (i.e. Interaction Designers, Visual Designers, User Researchers), Software Engineers, Programmers, Project Managers, Business Analysts, Sales Managers etc. who have worked on at least one project or a sales pitch that included HCI activities.</p>

          <h5>Submissions</h5>
          <p>The participants are requested to submit a two-page ethnography of a software development project or sales pitch involving HCI activities to <b>ethnography.workshop@gmail.com</b> by 5pm, October 15 2014. Participants will have to conduct ethnographic fieldwork in a software development organization for about a month. The ethnography should include:</p>

          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">A brief background of the context</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">A short narrative of the project / pitch as the events occurred</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">At least one instance of a conflict situation for HCI activities being implemented in SE</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Invited experts will review the submissions and intimate the participants by November 7 (TBC). Selected submissions will be circulated to all participants for prior reading before the workshop.</p>

          <h5>Submission Guidelines</h5>
  
          <p>Guidelines for conducting the fieldwork of the HCI work practices in your organization, and for writing an ethnography as a result of the fieldwork:</p>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Conduct participant observation of the HCI work practices in your organization in for a duration of approximately 1 month. Activities can include: writing personal notes, collecting meeting notes, tracking email communication, noting salient conversations, interviewing members of the community (e.g. HCI practitioners, software engineers, solution designers, project managers, clients, sales team, finance team), and collecting organizational artefacts such as project and process documents. Retrospective accounts of past projects and events can also be used, provided validity of the data can be achieved through personal records, email communications, retrospective interviews, project documents etc.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Identify aspects that relate to HCI-SE integration within the collected data through affinity.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Write an ethnography that illustrates these aspects and embraces the practical and sociological aspects of HCI-SE integration. Please note that ‘why’ and ‘how’ is more important than ‘what’ happened.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">It is important to maintain anonymity of individuals, organizations and proprietary information. It is expected that the ethnographic stories should tactfully avoid mention of any of these, without missing out the essence of the research being conducted.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">It is also important to note that the HCI research community would not judge the practitioners for their actions or decisions that are described in the ethnography, but would rather welcome an account of the goings-on in the industry. As such, it is expected that the ethnographers maintain the research rigor without any fear of being critiqued for their actions.</li>
          </ul>
