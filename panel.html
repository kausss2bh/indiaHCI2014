          <h4>Communication of cultural differences in HCI design process</h4>

          <p>More and more products are aimed at international target audiences. Working in international environments and with a global audience provides a number of challenges that has to do with the understanding of cultural differences and the communication of these.</p>
          <p>A recent research (July 2014) on how large companies perform international user studies found that companies do not collect data about end users in all the countries/regions they operate in. Instead, they focus on a few strategic markets. The researchers prefer to do field studies and to go to the field themselves to gain rich insights and to control the data collection process. Furthermore the companies are in the process of finding out how to best present the insights about international end users to their employees. So far, a best practice for incorporating both national cultural differences and cross-cultural similarities into persona descriptions, segmentations, etc. has not been found.</p>

          <p>This points to several challenges and the panel will discuss:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What strategies should we apply when we collect data in order to get data from the proper geographic areas?</li>
            <li>How do we communicate the cultural differences?</li>
            <li>When working with personas or other types of user characteristics how do we get the cultural<b id="panelists">&nbsp</b>differences described?</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <br>
